# fk-ik
 
I learnt how do forward kinematics; get the dh parameters and create the matrix for each dof, inverse kinemtaics, gradient descent.

IK was working for me on this robot: https://github.com/sarthak-wadhawan/simple-arm
I chose to do a new robot as i wanted to do everything from scratch. I calculated the fk and ik by hand for my robot in this repo but it does not work for some reason. IK working demo from the other repo is attached.
