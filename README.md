# fk-ik
 
I learnt how do forward kinematics; get the dh parameters and create the matrix for each dof, inverse kinemtaics, gradient descent.

IK was working for me on this robot: https://github.com/sarthak-wadhawan/simple-arm
I chose to do a new robot as i wanted to do everything from scratch. I calculated the fk and ik by hand for my robot in this repo but it does not work for some reason. IK working demo from the other repo is attached [here](https://mavsuta-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sxw8186_mavs_uta_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fsxw8186%5Fmavs%5Futa%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2024%2D10%2D12%2018%2D14%2D27%2Emkv&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2Ec64ed4c4%2D0202%2D4cf0%2Da40e%2D94892da4713d)
